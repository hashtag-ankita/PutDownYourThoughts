# Blogging Application  

A Django-powered blogging application to create, manage, and share blog posts. The project has moved beyond initialization, with several features now functional and the foundation for a robust blogging platform well underway.  

**Note:** The name of the project is yet to be finalized, so it will temporarily be referred to as **"Blogging Application"**.

## **Purpose**  

The purpose of this project is to create a platform where users can:  

- Write and share blogs.  
- Organize posts by categories and tags.  
- Track and display posts by popularity or personal preference.  

This project also serves as a hands-on learning experience in developing scalable and maintainable Django applications.
